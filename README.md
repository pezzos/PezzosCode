# Docs That Remember 🧠

> A documentation system that captures what you built, why you built it, and what you learned. Designed for human-LLM collaboration.

## The Problem

Most development teams have one of two problems:

1. **No documentation** - Everything lives in people's heads. LLMs have no context. New team members are lost.
2. **Stale documentation** - Tons of outdated docs scattered across tools that nobody maintains.

## The Solution

**Docs That Remember** is different. It's a documentation system that captures:

- **WHY** things exist (vision, decisions)
- **WHAT** you're building (product specs, features)
- **HOW** you built it (implementation, design)
- **WHAT HAPPENED** when you shipped (validation, bugs)
- **WHAT YOU LEARNED** (insights that compound over time)

It's the **MEMORY** that most teams miss.

## What Makes This Different

### 1. Logs Over Perfect Docs

Chronological logs never go stale. We capture reality as it happens, not aspirational documentation that becomes outdated.

### 2. Built for AI Collaboration

Clear structure and templates that LLMs can understand and fill out. Every feature has the context an AI needs to help you effectively.

### 3. Learning Built-In

Track what you expected vs what actually happened. Extract insights. Get smarter with every feature you ship.

### 4. Just-in-Time Documentation

Don't document everything upfront. Document before (specs), during (decisions), and after (outcomes). Only what matters, when it matters.

## Quick Start

### 1. Bootstrap the kit into your repo

Use the helper script from this repo:

```bash
./tools/bootstrap-into /path/to/your/project
```

Or copy the core files manually:

```bash
cp -R docs /path/to/your/project/
cp AGENTS.md /path/to/your/project/
cp Makefile /path/to/your/project/
cp -R tools/offload-proxy /path/to/your/project/tools/offload-proxy
```

### 2. Fill Out Your Context (30 minutes)

Start with these three files:

1. **`docs/00-context/vision.md`** - Why your product exists
2. **`docs/00-context/system-map.md`** - What's running right now
3. **`docs/01-product/prd.md`** - What you're building

### 3. Build Your First Feature

Create a feature folder:

```bash
mkdir docs/02-features/your-feature-name
cp -r docs/02-features/feature-template/* docs/02-features/your-feature-name/
```

Fill out:

- `feature-spec.md` - What and why
- `tech-design.md` - How you'll build it
- `dev-tasks.md` - Task breakdown
- `test-plan.md` - How you'll validate it

### 4. Ship and Learn

After shipping, update:

- `docs/03-logs/implementation-log.md` - What you built
- `docs/03-logs/validation-log.md` - What actually happened
- `docs/03-logs/insights.md` - What you learned

## How to Run Codex Here

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for repo-specific rules.
2. Work from the repo root.
3. Use a per-repo config by running:

```bash
codex -C .
```

If you use profiles or overrides, add them to `.codex.toml`.

## Workflow Ticket

Use this template to keep work scoped and traceable:

```
Title:
Goal:
Context (docs/ links):
Scope (in/out):
Acceptance criteria:
Tests:
Logs to update:
```

## Philosophy

### Documentation is Memory

Most teams forget why they made decisions. This system captures the **context**, **reality**, and **learning** at every step.

### Logs Are Eternal

Perfect docs go stale. Chronological logs of what happened are forever useful.

### AI-Native Structure

Templates LLMs can fill out. Context for every feature. Prompts that work. Built for human-AI collaboration from day one.

### Single Source of Truth

Every type of information has ONE place. No duplication, no confusion.

## Who This Is For

- **Solo developers** working with AI assistants
- **Small teams** who need structure without bureaucracy
- **Startups** moving fast but wanting to capture learnings
- **Anyone** building with LLMs

## Examples

### Shipping a Feature

1. **Plan** - Fill out feature spec, tech design, tasks (1-2 hours)
2. **Build** - Work through tasks, log decisions (days/weeks)
3. **Ship** - Deploy, update system map (1 hour)
4. **Validate** - Track metrics, update logs (ongoing)

### Fixing a Bug

1. Document in bug log
2. Fix and test
3. Update implementation log
4. Update bug log with root cause

### Making a Decision

1. Document options in decision log
2. Choose and explain rationale
3. Implement
4. Review outcome later

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

Don't overthink it. Start small:

**Day 1:** Create vision.md - Clarify your thinking

**Day 2:** Map your current system - Find gaps

**Day 3:** Write a PRD for next feature - Save hours of confusion

**Day 4:** Log what you built - Future you will thank you

**Day 5+:** Track outcomes and extract insights - This is where magic happens
