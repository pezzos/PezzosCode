# Definition of Done

> **When docs/code are "done"**
>
> Clear, unambiguous criteria for when a task, feature, or document is complete. This prevents miscommunication and ensures consistent quality.

---

## Purpose

This document defines what "done" means for:
- Features
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Refactoring
- Technical debt

Clear "done" criteria ensure:
- Nothing gets shipped half-finished
- Quality standards are maintained
- Everyone has the same expectations
- No confusion about whether something is complete

## Quality Gates

These are non-negotiable minimums. Work cannot be considered "done" without meeting these:

### Code Quality Gates
- ✅ Passes linter with no errors
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities (from security scanner)
- ✅ Code coverage ≥ 80% (or same as before)
- ✅ No console.log or debug code left in
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Testing Quality Gates
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ All acceptance criteria tested
- ✅ Critical paths have E2E tests

### Review Quality Gates
- ✅ At least one approval from another developer
- ✅ No unresolved "must fix" comments

### Deployment Quality Gates
- ✅ Deployed to staging first
- ✅ Tested on staging
- ✅ Rollback plan ready
- ✅ No production errors after deployment

---

## Exceptions

Sometimes we need to ship before meeting all "done" criteria. This is okay IF:

### Documented Exception
- [ ] Reason for exception documented
- [ ] What's missing documented
- [ ] Plan to complete documented
- [ ] Stakeholders informed and agreed

### Time-Boxed
- [ ] Deadline set for completing missing items
- [ ] Reminder/task created to finish

### Not Critical
- [ ] Missing items are not critical (e.g., docs can follow code by a few days)
- [ ] No security/data/critical functionality issues

### Example Exception
```markdown
## Known Incomplete Items

**What's missing:** User guide for new export feature

**Why:** Feature needs to ship today for customer demo, user guide takes 2 more hours

**Plan:** User guide will be completed by Friday (2 days)

**Impact:** Internal users can use feature without docs, external users won't see it until docs done

**Approved by:** [Product Manager name]
```
